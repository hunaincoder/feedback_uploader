# Feedback Uploader Script

This script processes feedback files from a specified directory and posts them to a remote server.

## Description

The script reads feedback files from the `/data/feedback` directory. Each feedback file is expected to be a text file with the following format:
1. Title
2. Name
3. Date
4. Feedback (the rest of the file content)

The script will read these files, extract the feedback data, and send it as JSON to a specified URL using a POST request.

## Features

- Reads `.txt` files from the feedback directory.
- Extracts title, name, date, and feedback from each file.
- Sends the feedback data to a remote server via a POST request.
- Handles errors such as missing files or directories and reports them.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)

## Usage

1. **Set Up the Feedback Directory**

   Ensure the directory `/data/feedback` exists and contains `.txt` files with the correct format.

2. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python feedback_uploader.py
   ```

3. **Configure the Server URL**

   Modify the `url` variable in the script to point to your server endpoint:

   ```python
   url = 'http://your-server-url/feedback'
   ```

## Error Handling

- If the feedback directory does not exist, the script will output an error message and exit.
- If a file cannot be read, an error message will be displayed.
- If the POST request fails, the script will print the HTTP status code and response text.

## Example

Given a feedback file `feedback1.txt` with the following content:

```
Great Service
John Doe
2024-09-16
I really enjoyed the service. Keep up the good work!
```

The script will send the following JSON to the server:

```json
{
  "title": "Great Service",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "date": "2024-09-16",
  "feedback": "I really enjoyed the service. Keep up the good work!"
}
```
